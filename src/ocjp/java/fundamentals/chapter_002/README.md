### Data Types

1. In __Java__ every variable and every expression has some time
2. Each and every data type is clearly defined.
3. Every assignment should be checked by compiler for type compatibility

because of above reason we can conclude __Java__ language is strongly typed programming language


Java is not considered as pure object oriented programming language because 
several oops feature are not satisfied by java ( like operator loading and multiple inheritance etc..)

More over we are depending on primitive data types which are non objects.

                     Primitive Data Types (8)
                                |    
         ---------------------------------------------------------
         |                                                       |
         |                                                       |
  Numeric Data Types                                    Non-Numeric Data Types (2)
          |                                                   * char
          |                                                   * boolean           
  ------------------------                                  
  |                       |                                     
  |                 Floating Point Data Types (2)                                     
  |                        * float
  |                        * double                                                                         
  | 
 Integral Data Types (4) 
        * byte
        * short
        * int
        * long
    
 ```
 
 Except Boolean and Char remaing data types are considered as Signed data types, 
 because we can represent both positive and negative numbers
